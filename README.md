The purpose of this assignment was to understand the fundementals of particles and how to manipulate them to create whatever effect desired. In my project, when you press the left mouse button it will simulate snowfall. Things I learned throughout the process of completing this project were how to change the colors of particles, how to change the velocity and size of the particles, and how to delay a color changing effect.
